## GENERAL INFO

This application is not any interesting for everyone who's not a car enthusiast. It's just more of a "testing ground" for me while learning Vue. I originally wrote this App in React and now rewrote it **from scratch with Vue** to compare the difference between React and Vue.

The app was written based on a mobile-first approach and it's fully responsive üì±üíªüñ•

Accessibility is at a high level ‚ôø

The app has it's own favicon ‚ö°

Lines of code rewritten from tutorials: 0 ‚úî

The layout was designed by me in Figma üñç

All photos have been cropped and their size has been reduced accordingly (to minimize file size) üñº‚úÇ
